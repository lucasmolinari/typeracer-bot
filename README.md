# typeracer-bot
Python script to automatize games like typeracer.

That was a really fun project, I used some image recognition libraries just for learning and etc.
Of course that wasn't the best way to approach the problem, I could probably use web scrapping.

Overall it was just a one day project (3 hours most likely), where I learned a lot about image treatment and  keyboard automatization.
I hope to get the chance to use some of the conceps learned.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
