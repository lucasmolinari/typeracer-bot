# typeracer-bot
Python script to automatize games like typeracer.

That was a really fun project, I used some image recognition libraries just for learning and etc.
Of course that wasn't the best way to approach the problem, I could probably use web scrapping.
Tried to make the most human typing, so it isn't so fast, but if you want to make it faster you can just change the variables. It literally can type everything instantly.

Overall it was just a one day project (3 hours most likely), where I learned a lot about image treatment and  keyboard automatization.
I hope to get the chance to use some of the conceps learned.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
